# Setup

## Groq API

The Groq API is **free** to use, but subject to rate limits. For the free version, that's 30 requests per minute. 

1. Head over to [Groq](https://console.groq.com/keys) to create an account and an API key. 
2. Paste your API key in `GROQ_API_KEY` in Replit secrets. 

If you'd like to use OpenAI, simply swap the `Groq()` instance for `OpenAI()` and change both the library and modelâ€”it should be plug and play.

## Google Sheets

1. Enable the [Sheets API](https://pygsheets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/authorization.html#authorizing-pygsheets) in your Google Developer Console (you may have to create a "project" first).
2. Create a [service account](https://pygsheets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/authorization.html#service-account)
3. Paste your service account JSON (the entire thing) into the variable `SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` in Replit secrets. 
4. Share your Google Sheet with the service account.

## Populating Fake Data

The [`datagen.py`](../datagen.py) can be used to create fake data. Much of the code was borrowed from the [estuary](https://github.com/estuary/examples/tree/main/google-sheets-pinecone-rag/datagen) team .

If you'd like to use fake data:
1. Create a new sheet in your Google Drive with the name "Fake Customer Support."
2. Create a worksheet within that sheet with the name "Support Requests."
3. Be sure to share the sheet with your service account email
4. Run `python datagen.py` in the Shell!
