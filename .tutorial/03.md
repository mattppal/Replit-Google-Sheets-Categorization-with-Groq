# Configuring the app

Head to [app.py](../app.py). If you're using the fake data mentioned in the previous step, everything's all set. If not, 

1. Change `WRITE_COL` and `SUMMARY_COL` to match your output and inputs, respectively.
2. Update the `SHEET_NAME` and `WORKSHEET_NAME` environment variables so that the script can find the right Sheet / Worksheet in your account (a worksheet is a page _within_ a sheet).

## Customizing the prompt

To see the prompt we're currently using, head to [line 42](https://replit.com/@replit-matt/AI-Data-Enrichment-with-Google-Sheets#app.py:42).

We're first defining our categories, then defining a prompt to pass to Groq. You can modify the categories or the prompt. Our categories are currently:

```python
"Technical Issue", "Billing Issue", "General Inquiry",
"Product Feedback", "Feature Request", "Security Concern"
```

You can see in [line 56](https://replit.com/@replit-matt/AI-Data-Enrichment-with-Google-Sheets#app.py:56) that we're getting the `SUMMARY_COL` we defined earlier and passing it in as a user request. 

The requests are formatted in the `messages` parameter of the `completion` from Groqâ€”where is the system and user prompt going?

We're also constraining the number of tokens and providing a seed to ensure consistent output on that request.
